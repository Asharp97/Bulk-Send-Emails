# 📧 Bulk Send Emails – Python Email Automation Tool

**Bulk Send Emails** is a Python-based tool that automates sending personalized emails to recipients listed in an Excel file.  
Unlike typical bulk emailers, this project follows **industry best practices** to ensure high deliverability and prevent messages from being flagged as spam.

## 🚀 Why Bulk Send Emails?

Mass email tools often overlook **deliverability**—leading to messages ending up in spam folders.  
Bulk Send Emails was designed with a **professional-first mindset**:  

- ✅ Reads recipient lists directly from Excel (.xlsx, .csv)  
- ✉️ Sends emails **individually** (not as a single bulk message)  
- 📝 Supports **personalized fields** (name, company, etc.)  
- 🔒 Implements **email best practices** (headers, formatting, throttling)  
- 📬 Minimizes risk of spam classification with smart sending strategies  

This is not a spam tool—it’s a **reliable automation solution** for sending out event invites, newsletters, or company updates **the right way**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `smtplib` – for sending emails  
  - `email` – for MIME formatting and headers  
  - `openpyxl` / `pandas` – for reading Excel/CSV files  
  - *(add `dotenv` if you used it for secrets)*

## 📊 Usage

1. Prepare your recipient list in **Excel** with headers like:

| Name       | Email                                         | Company      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| John Doe   | [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)   | Example Corp |
| Jane Smith | [jane@business.org](mailto:jane@business.org) | Business Ltd |

2. Create an **email template** (e.g. `welcome.html`):

```html
Hello {{Name}},

We’re excited to connect with you at {{Company}}!

Best regards,

```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python bulk_send.py --template templates/welcome.html --list emails.xlsx
```

Each recipient gets a **personalized** message.
